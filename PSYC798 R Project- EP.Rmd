Project requirements:
1) I chose the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) as my dataset
2) I ran a probit regression and created a few figures

```{r}
# Libraries & Importing Data
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
CHIS <- read_dta("/Users/ellepope/Desktop/R Class/Project/R_Dataset.dta")

# Viewing Data
nrow(CHIS)
ncol(CHIS)
colnames(CHIS)
head(CHIS)
sapply(CHIS, class)
summary(CHIS)

# Viewing & reformatting relevant variables
  # Voted in 2016
summary(as.factor(CHIS$vote_pres16))
voted <- as.factor(CHIS$vote_pres16)
levels(voted)<-c("1","2",NA,NA)
levels(voted)
summary(voted)
    
  # Poverty Level
summary(as.factor(CHIS$povll))
poverty <- as.factor(CHIS$povll)
levels(poverty)<-c("1","2","3","4")
levels(poverty)
summary(poverty)

# Probit Regression 
myregression<- 
    glm(formula = voted ~ poverty, family = binomial(link ="probit"), data = CHIS)
summary(myregression)

# Playing with graphics
plot <- ggplot(CHIS, aes(poverty)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = voted)) + 
        scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired", name="Voted",
        breaks=c("1", "2", "NA"),
        labels=c("Yes", "No", "NA")) +
        ggtitle("% of Federal Poverty Level by 2016 election votes") + 
        xlab("% of FPL")
plot
        
povlbs <- c("0-99%", "100-199%", "200-299%", "300% +")
barplot(table(poverty), ylim=c(0,20000), 
        label_value = povlbs,
        xlab = "% of Federal Poverty Level", 
        ylab = "# of Respondents", 
        axis.lty = "solid", space = .5)

votelbls <- c("Yes (73%)", "No (27%)")
pie(table(voted),
    labels = votelbls,
    col = c("royalblue", "firebrick"),
    main = "# of People who voted in 2016 Election in California")
```
